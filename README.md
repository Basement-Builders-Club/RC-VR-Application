# VR-Application
 The VR application for the FPV RC car
## How to install and use
- This program is built off of the Unity Game Engine, so to properly view and edit the program first install Unity Hub and install the 2022.3.20f1 LTS version of the editor inside of Unity Hub.
- Afterwards, click "Add" then "Add project from disk" (assuming you have downloaded the project from the github) and navigate to the FPV Application folder inside of the repo folder (this is the project folder), and select it.
- This should now let you view and edit the project on your own in the Unity editor. Currently the project is set for Oculus in the XR settings (Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management), you may have to change that depending on what VR headset you are using.
- If you don't have a VR Headset there is an "XR Device Simulator" object included, enable this object and when you hit play you will have a simulated VR camera and controllers that you can interact with on PC.
